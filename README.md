Live single page application
========

This is a study as well as a demo of a real-time, single page application using Socket.io. In this particular example Node.js and Express are used in the back-end and AngularJs in the front-end. However the architecture used makes no assumptions as to what technologies are used (other than maybe Socket.io). For more info checkout the wiki https://github.com/harleivicente/live-spa/wiki.
